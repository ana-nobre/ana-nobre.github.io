      <h3>🌍 About Me</h3>
      <p>I’m a global transformation leader with over 10 years at Apple Inc., where I’ve led multicultural teams and managed strategic operations across Brazil, Mexico, Spain, and the United States—empowering people, scaling impact, and driving sustainable growth through data-informed strategy and operational excellence.</p>
      <p>My international journey began in Brazil and continued through Mexico and Spain, with key contributions to US operations along the way. While based in Brazil, I collaborated with US supply chain and retail teams to direct the rollout and optimization of logistics processes and implement Brazil-specific operations for the country’s first two retail stores.</p>
      <p>In Mexico, I led B2B growth strategies—resulting in a 22% increase in revenue—while managing team evacuations during earthquakes and navigating COVID-era labor regulations. In Spain, I negotiated with labor unions and redesigned operational processes, increasing service availability by 27%.</p>
      <p>As a Senior Manager in both countries, I led a team of managers responsible for technical support, B2B, logistics and operations, sales, the Today@Apple program, and HR representation. I orchestrated these domains cross-functionally, translating strategic objectives into execution—demonstrating key program management capabilities such as stakeholder alignment, agile leadership, impact measurement, and cross-regional delivery.</p>
      <p>A lifelong learner, I have completed three postgraduate degrees and several advanced business courses, most recently earning a Distinction-grade Master’s in International Business Management from the University of Birmingham, where I applied real-world methodologies such as Kaizen, Agile, and Six Sigma within the UK market context.</p>
      <p>To further enhance my data-driven decision-making, I am currently expanding my technical fluency through a Data Analytics Bootcamp, building advanced skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. This journey is reinforcing my belief in the power of analytics to amplify strategic impact.</p>
      <p>With a leadership style grounded in empathy, agility, and execution, I believe that a people-oriented approach is one of the most powerful ways to achieve outstanding and sustainable business results.</p>
