      <h2>🌍 About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a global transformation leader with over 10 years at Apple Inc., where I've led multicultural teams and strategic programs across Brazil, Mexico, Spain — with key contributions to US operations—empowering people, scaling impact, and driving sustainable growth through data-informed strategy and operational excellence.</p>
      <p>My international journey began in Brazil and continued through Mexico and Spain, with key contributions to US operations along the way. While based in Brazil, I collaborated with US supply chain and retail teams to direct the rollout and optimization of logistics processes and implement Brazil-specific operations for the country's first two retail stores.</p>
      <p>In Mexico, I led B2B growth strategies—resulting in a 22% increase in revenue—while managing team evacuations during earthquakes and navigating COVID-era labor regulations. In Spain, I negotiated with labor unions and redesigned operational processes, increasing service availability by 27%.</p>
      <p>As a Senior Manager in both countries, I led a team of managers responsible for technical support, B2B, logistics and operations, sales, the Today@Apple program, and HR representation. I orchestrated these domains cross-functionally, translating strategic objectives into execution—demonstrating key program management capabilities such as stakeholder alignment, agile leadership, impact measurement, and cross-regional delivery.</p>
      <p>A lifelong learner, I have completed three postgraduate degrees and several advanced business courses, most recently earning a Distinction-grade Master's in International Business Management from the University of Birmingham, where I applied real-world methodologies such as Kaizen, Agile, and Six Sigma within the UK market context.</p>
      <p>To further enhance my data-driven decision-making, I am currently expanding my technical fluency through a Data Analytics Bootcamp, building advanced skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. This journey is reinforcing my belief in the power of analytics to amplify strategic impact.</p>
      <p>With a leadership style grounded in empathy, agility, and execution, I believe that a people-oriented approach is one of the most powerful ways to achieve outstanding and sustainable business results.</p>
